A funny pygame game I'm making

This game is an infinite game where Mario jumps on some freaky goombas. The app
just uses pygame for creating the interface, getting keyboard input, and
working with sprites. This is my first pygame project and I plan to add
platforms and expand this into a fully fledged game. I will probably change the
sprites if I'm going to expand the game any.

To run the project, open your IDE in the folder where the game files are
located and run the game. There will be an error if you aren't cd'd into the
folder with the png files.
